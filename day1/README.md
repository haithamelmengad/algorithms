## Day 1 - Interview Prep

Concepts: **Big O notation, Arrays, Linked Lists, and Stacks**

Hello everyone! We'll split today's schedule into 4 different main sections (excluding the bonuses):

1. [Warmup Quiz: Big O Notation]()
1. [Implementing Data Structures from scratch]()
1. [Programming Problems (Using Arrays, Linked Lists, and Stacks)]()
1. [Review Quiz: Big O Notation]()
1. [Bonus!]()

## Warmup Quiz

> Try not to spend more than 15 minutes for this.

1. Skim through [https://www.interviewcake.com/article/java/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity](https://www.interviewcake.com/article/java/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity)
1. [I'm ready!](https://goo.gl/forms/KUdCZ2tYnqK1c1Yk1)

## Implementing Data Structures

> Try to complete these exercises by 1:30 PM.

1. Singly Linked Lists (Head and Tail) -> Big O

2. Stacks -> Big O -> Show how to do it in array, now ask students implement in linked lists

## Programming Problems

> Try to complete these exercises by 5:00 PM.

Before we proceed, do register for an account on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com). We would highly recommend doing all of the selected problems in **JavaScript**.

### Warm Up

## Bonus #1

Ranked from easiest to hardest:

1. Sets -> Big O
1. Implement Queue using Stacks -> Big O
1. [Rotate Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/tabs/description)
1. [Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/tabs/description)
1. [Maximal Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/tabs/description)

## Bonus #2

Also, here are a few questions to try out. Note that these are actual in-person interview questions. There are no tests for these questions. Feel free to talk to a TA about your approach.

1. **Quora**: Given a array with numbers which are increasing in beginning and decreasing in the end, find the maximum number in O(log n). examples: [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4,5,3,2], [4,2,1]
1. **Wish**: Given an array of unique integers, return list of permutations.
2. **Wish**: Given an array of unique integers, return list of all subsets.
1. **Google**: Given an array and a value `x`, remove all instances of that `x` **in place** and return the new length. The order of elements can be changed.
1. **Google**: Check if a number is rotatable 180 degree.
1. **Bloomberg**: Given an array and the number `k`, return the `k` smallest elements in the array.
