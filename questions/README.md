# The Big List of Interview Questions

## How to use these questions

For **Knowledge Questions**, research and write down the answer for each
question. We recommend using something like [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/)
to be able to study your answers later.

For **Programming Questions**, we suggest setting aside an uninterrupted
chunk of time for each problem and trying to solve it in one go.
If you can't solve a problem on the first try, don't worry.
Research potential solutions then come back to it again the next day.
While researching solutions to programming questions, take care not
to look at other people's solution code. Instead opt to read
verbal descriptions or watch YouTube tutorials, then try to
convert your understanding into code.
