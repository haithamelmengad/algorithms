1. Undirected Graph: Edit `graph.js`
    >**Note:** We're back to es5 prototypes for this exercise (you won't always be working with es6 after all)
    >Open `graphs.html` to test

2. Maze: Edit `maze.js`
    >NOTE: Look familiar? We've come full circle, let's see how you do 11 weeks later.
    >Open `maze.html`
