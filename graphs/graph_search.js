// THE GRAPH

// A graph is one of the most fundamental, important, and broadly useful data
// structures in computer science. Let's begin by implementing a graph.

// As you saw in class, you can implement a graph in multiple ways including
// by using an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix. Pick one, and fill in the
// empty methods below to fully implement a graph. For now we'll build an
// unweighted, undirected graph.

// Suggested reading: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs

// Return true if the graph is connected, false otherwise.
Graph.prototype.isConnected = function() {
  // YOUR CODE HERE
};

Graph.prototype.hasCycle = function() {

};

Graph.prototype.dfs = function() {

Graph.prototype.bfs = function() {
